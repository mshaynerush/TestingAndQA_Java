To ensure that my code, program or software is functional and secure, I used JUnit tests to test various aspects of the possible inputs my porgram might receive and tested them against the requirements. With coverage almost at 100% according to the coverage test, but 100% according to what I know was tested, the code will only accept proper inputs based on the user specifications

I interpreted the user needs by looking at the requirements and understanding what the data should look like and what it should NOT look like and I wrote my code to test against those parameters whilst also tesing to ensure they failed when they were supposed to fail and succeded when success was the goal.

When I approach designing software, I consider which components must be created and make sure all member variables for classes are represented along with which methods will be required. Using the user requirements I consider not only what the user needs, but how can an end user of the software break the program, either on purpose or by human error. Once I have a clear idea, I will ceate the object part of the class, then for any function classes, in the case of this repository, the Contact class and then the ContactService class respectively, I will create the actions associated with the Class, such as adding a contact, deleting and updating.

After that, it's time to test, test, test.
